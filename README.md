# Rice-Seeder-Missing-Seeding-Alarm-System
 In order to explore the solution to deal with the missing seeding problems of rice seeder, designed the system with the functions of accurate measurement and wireless transmission of detection data , and it based on microcontrollers and image recognition technique.

# Overview
The system uses a camera module named OpenMV as the detection core, and the wireless transceiver chip named NRF24L01 as wireless data transmission module, and the STM32 series microcontrollers as the data transfer terminal and the data display and alarm terminal. The work procedure of the whole system is that when the camera module detects the seeds in the field of vision, it uses image processing and recognition technique to identify the seeds and calculate the number of seeds. The processed data is transmitted to a microcontroller through serial port and then wirelessly sent to another microcontroller. The specific value is displayed in real time through the LCD screen, and corresponding alarm is given according to the specified quantity and detection quantity. After many tests, this system has high detection accuracy, stability and reliability.
